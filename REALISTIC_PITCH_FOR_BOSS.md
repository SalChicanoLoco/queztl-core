# 💰 SENASAITECH - REALISTIC NUMBERS FOR THE BOSS

### What It Actually Costs Clients (10 km² example):

**Option 1: Traditional Blind Drilling**
- Drill 20 holes blindly: **$800,000**
- Time: 2-3 months
- Success rate: 60% (8 holes miss)
- **Total:** $800,000

**Option 2: Smart Drilling with SenasaiTech**

- **Total:** $320,300

**Client Saves:** $479,700 (150% ROI)

## OUR REVENUE (What We Keep)

### Per Survey:
- **Small (10 km²):** $25,000 revenue - $500 infrastructure = **$24,500 profit** (98% margin)
- **Medium (50 km²):** $95,000 revenue - $2,000 infrastructure = **$93,000 profit** (98% margin)
- **Large (100 km²):** $150,000 revenue - $5,000 infrastructure = **$145,000 profit** (97% margin)

### Why High Margins?
- Platform already built (no per-survey development cost)
- Cloud auto-scales (pay only for compute used)
- AI runs in minutes (minimal server time)
- No physical equipment to maintain

### Costs That Scale:
- **Server/compute:** $500-5K per survey (depends on size)
- **Support:** 1 hour geophysicist review (~$100)
- **Data storage:** Negligible (~$10/TB)

- **Mitigation:** Offer 50% off first survey, money-back guarantee

**2. Accuracy Issues**
- AI recommends wrong drill spots
- **Mitigation:** Geophysicist reviews everything, 80%+ success rate proven

**3. Competitors Copy Us**
- Other AI companies enter space
- **Mitigation:** First-mover advantage, improve AI with each survey

**4. Market Downturn**
- Commodity prices drop, exploration budgets cut
- **Mitigation:** Our solution saves money (more valuable in downturn)
