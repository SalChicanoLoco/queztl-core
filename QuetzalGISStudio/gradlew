#
#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh does
#       not find it, but has a "bash" then use "bash" as the shell.
#
#   (2) The slurpfile JVM option requires all of the JVM heap
#       options (-Xmx, -Xms) to be before -jar in the command line.
#
#   Gradle will try to download Gradle itself if necessary.
#
#   CLASSPATH contains base + extensions.
#
#   GRADLE_OPTS environment variable (if set) contains options for the JVM running Gradle.
#   Use it to set custom socket factory etc.
