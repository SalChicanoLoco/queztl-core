# 🎮 Web GPU Driver - Explained for Everyone

## What Did We Build?

Imagine you want to play a video game or use a 3D design tool in your web browser. Normally, you'd need an expensive **graphics card** (GPU) in your computer - the same kind gamers buy for $300-$1,500.

**We built software that does the same job WITHOUT needing that expensive hardware!** 🚀
