# 🦅 Queztl Core - YOUR Infrastructure (No Cloud BS)

## The Real Setup

You're building your **own compute infrastructure**. Got it.

## Questions to Understand Your Setup:

### 1. What hardware do you have?
- [ ] Your own servers in a rack somewhere?
- [ ] Multiple computers at your location?
- [ ] Planning to buy servers?
- [ ] Raspberry Pi cluster? (jk... unless?)
- [ ] Other: _______________

### 2. Where does Queztl Core run?
- [ ] Same building as your Mac?
- [ ] Remote location?
- [ ] Distributed across multiple locations?
- [ ] Still planning?

### 3. Network setup?
- [ ] All on local network (192.168.x.x)?
- [ ] VPN connecting locations?
- [ ] Public IPs?
- [ ] Mix of local + remote?

### 4. What's the deployment target?
- [ ] Linux servers you control
- [ ] Bare metal machines
- [ ] Your own VM infrastructure (KVM, Proxmox, etc.)
- [ ] Docker Swarm on your servers
- [ ] Kubernetes on your hardware

## Tell Me:

1. **Do you have servers already?** (Yes/No/Planning to buy)

2. **How many machines?** (1? 3? 10?)

3. **What OS?** (Ubuntu? Debian? CentOS? Other?)

4. **Can you SSH to them from your Mac?** (Yes/No)

5. **Do they have Docker installed?** (Yes/No/Will install)

6. **Same network as your Mac or remote?**

7. **What's the endgame?** 
   - Build your own data center?
   - Cluster of servers at your office?
   - Sell Queztl Core as appliance/hardware?
   - Just want massive compute without paying AWS?

---

## Once You Tell Me, I'll Build:

### If you have servers NOW:
```bash
# One command deployment to YOUR infrastructure
./deploy-to-my-servers.sh

# What it does:
# 1. SSH to each server
# 2. Install dependencies
# 3. Deploy Queztl components
# 4. Start services
# 5. Health check
```

### If you're planning infrastructure:
- Server specs recommendations
- Network topology
- Installation guide
- Cost estimates for hardware

### If you want portable/appliance:
- Package Queztl Core as bootable image
- Deploy on any hardware
- Plug & play setup

## No Cloud Provider BS - Just:

**YOUR hardware + YOUR network + YOUR Queztl Core** 🦅

**Tell me what you got and I'll make it work.**
