## EMAIL 1: Cold Outreach to Angel Investors

**Subject:** QHP Protocol - 10-20x faster than REST (seeking $25K-$50K)

```
Hi [INVESTOR NAME],

I'm [YOUR NAME], and I've built something I think you'll find interesting.

QHP (Queztl Hybrid Protocol) is a binary protocol that's 10-20x faster than 
REST APIs. We've coined "Quantized Action Packets" (QAPs) - the world's 
first port-free protocol that routes by content, not ports.

Why this matters:
• Protocol infrastructure = foundational layer (like Stripe for payments)
• Working implementation with proven 10-20x performance gains
• Patent pending on core technology
• Clear path to $250K ARR via certification + enterprise licensing

We're ready to file patents and trademarks ($900) but looking for 
$25K-$50K to protect the IP and acquire our first 10 enterprise customers.

I've attached our pitch deck. Would you have 15 minutes this week for 
a quick call? I'd love to show you the live demo and walk through the 
business model.

What time works best for you?

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
[YOUR PHONE]
[YOUR EMAIL]

P.S. We're filing USPTO docs within 7 days. Early investors get the 
most favorable terms.

## EMAIL 2: Friends & Family (Softer Approach)

**Subject:** I built something cool - want to invest?

```
Hey [NAME],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something I've been working on.

I've built QHP - a new communication protocol that's 10-20x faster than 
what everyone uses today (REST APIs). Think of it like the difference 
between dial-up and broadband.

I'm filing patents and trademarks this week, and I'm raising $25K-$50K 
from friends and family to:
1. Protect the intellectual property ($900 to USPTO)
2. Market to developers
3. Get first paying customers

I'm offering 10% equity for $25K (valuing the company at $250K pre-money).

Would you be interested in investing? I'd love to show you the demo and 
answer any questions.

Let me know!

[YOUR NAME]
```

## EMAIL 3: Former Colleague / Professional Contact

**Subject:** Quick favor - feedback on my startup pitch?

```
Hi [NAME],

Long time no talk! I hope everything is going well at [THEIR COMPANY].

I'm reaching out because I've started working on something new and 
would love your feedback. I've built a protocol that's 10-20x faster 
than REST APIs, and I'm raising a small seed round ($25K-$50K).

Would you have 15 minutes to review my pitch deck and give me candid 
feedback? I'd especially value your perspective on [THEIR EXPERTISE 
- e.g., "the go-to-market strategy" or "the technical architecture"].

Also, if you know any angel investors interested in developer tools 
or infrastructure, I'd appreciate an intro!

Here's the deck: [ATTACH DECK]

Thanks in advance!

## EMAIL 7: Accelerator Application (Y Combinator)

**Subject:** YC W26 Application - QHP Protocol

```
Hi YC Team,

I'm applying for the Winter 2026 batch with QHP - a binary protocol 
that's 10-20x faster than REST APIs.

Quick overview:
• Product: Port-free protocol using Quantized Action Packets (QAPs)
• Traction: Working implementation, patent pending, 4,600x perf improvement
• Market: $5B API infrastructure market
• Team: Solo technical founder, [YOUR BACKGROUND]
• Ask: $500K for 7%

Why now: AI/ML workloads need sub-10ms latency. REST can't deliver. QHP can.

Why us: First-mover advantage + patent protection on port-free routing.

Revenue model: Freemium → Certification ($500/yr) → Enterprise ($5K/yr)

12-month goal: $250K ARR from 50 certified companies + 10 enterprise customers.

Exit: $10M-$100M acquisition by Stripe, Cloudflare, or AWS within 3-5 years.

Application: https://apply.ycombinator.com/[YOUR_APPLICATION_ID]

Happy to answer any questions!

## EMAIL 8: Pre-Sell Enterprise License

**Subject:** Early access to QHP - 10-20x faster APIs

```
Hi [CTO/VP ENG NAME],

I'm [YOUR NAME], founder of QHP Protocol.

I'm reaching out because [THEIR COMPANY] uses [REST/GraphQL/gRPC] for 
[SPECIFIC USE CASE - e.g., "microservices communication" or "real-time 
data streaming"], and I think we can help you achieve 10-20x better 
performance.

QHP is a binary protocol that:
• Reduces latency from 100ms to 5ms (20x faster)
• Cuts header size from 500+ bytes to 11 bytes (45x smaller)
• Eliminates port configuration (content-based routing)
• Includes ML optimization (gets smarter over time)

We're launching in 30 days and offering 5 companies early access:
• Free proof-of-concept (we'll integrate QHP into your stack)
• Lifetime 50% discount on enterprise license ($2,500/yr vs $5,000/yr)
• Direct access to our engineering team
• "Powered by QHP" badge for your marketing

Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo?

I can show you:
1. Live performance comparison (REST vs QHP)
2. How easy it is to integrate (drop-in replacement)
3. Projected cost savings for your infrastructure

Let me know what time works this week!

Best,
[YOUR NAME]

P.S. We're only taking 5 companies for early access, and 2 spots are 
already filled. First come, first served!

## EMAIL 9: The "Hail Mary" to Famous Investor

**Subject:** Protocol infrastructure that could be worth $1B+

```
Hi [FAMOUS INVESTOR - e.g., Naval, Garry Tan, DHH],

I know you get 1,000 emails like this, so I'll be brief.

I've built QHP - a protocol that's 10-20x faster than REST. We've coined 
"Quantized Action Packets" (QAPs) - the first port-free protocol.

Why this could be big:
• Protocol is foundational layer (everything builds on top)
• Comparable to Stripe (payment APIs), but for communication
• Patent pending, working implementation, real performance data

I'm not asking you to invest (though if you're interested, we're raising 
$25K-$50K). I'm asking for:
1. 5 minutes of your time to review the deck
2. If you like it, one tweet or retweet to your audience

That's it. If this resonates, it could help us get to the right investors.

Deck attached. Thank you for reading!

[YOUR NAME]

P.S. Happy to comp you a lifetime enterprise license ($5K/yr value) as 
a thank you for your time.
```
