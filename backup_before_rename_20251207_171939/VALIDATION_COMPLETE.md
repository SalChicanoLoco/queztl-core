   - Mitigation: Use bootimage crate (battle-tested)
   - Probability: Low | Impact: High

3. ✅ **QEMU compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Test on real hardware eventually
   - Probability: Medium | Impact: Medium

### Process Risks (2 identified)
1. ✅ **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Strict 10-point limit, no mid-sprint adds
   - Probability: High | Impact: Medium

```
Just say: "LET'S CODE!"

I will:
1. Install Rust toolchain (5 minutes)
2. Create project structure (instant)
3. Generate all 20+ files (instant)
4. First build (30 seconds)
5. First commit (instant)

Total time: ~6 minutes to working kernel project! 🚀
```

### Option 2: You Drive, I Guide
```
Run these commands, I'll help with any issues:

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Configure for bare-metal
rustup override set nightly
rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools-preview

# Create project
cd /Users/xavasena/hive
mkdir queztl-kernel && cd queztl-kernel
cargo init

# I'll then help you set up the config files!
```

### Option 3: Review First
```
Want to review any of these docs first?
- QUEZTL_KERNEL_ARCHITECTURE.md (technical deep dive)
- QUEZTL_AGILE_SCRUM.md (full product backlog)
